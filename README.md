# Introduction
This repository consists of a group coursework project from the NTU SC2207-Introduction to Databases course.
<br> The course teaches the principles of designing a database schema and SQL query techniques.
<br> This project involves simulating an online store management system with data saving and querying/tracking features.

# Overview:
The database was built by first designing an ER diagram and creating a relational schema for it. Through feedback from the TA and improvements, the ER diagram and relational schema were continually enhanced.
<br><br> Once the relational schema was finalized, the database was built on Microsoft SQL Server by creating the various tables and populating them with data.
<br><br> Finally, SQL queries were performed to obtain resutls for specific questions provided.

## Methodology
- Continuous development and improvement of ER diagram and relational schema
- Implement and build a database on Microsoft SQL Server
- Query the database to answer specified questions

# Results:
Successfully created and maintained an SQL database, and performed SQL queries to answer complex questions.
